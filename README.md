```
Average KNN Accuracy: 0.9593889325990034
Average Decision Tree Accuracy: 0.938290060319958
Average Lasso Accuracy: 0.9504656311556591
Average Random Forest Accuracy: 0.9610149488591659
Average Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.9528979805927091
```
==> Random Forest is the best

## Key Takeaways
<ul>
  <li>
    Predictive analysis shows GDP, Family, Health, and Freedom as strong contributors (in that order) to happiness
  </li>
  <li>
    No single factor is sufficient to bring about happiness. In countries with a high happiness ranking, multiple factors (e.g., those listed above) work together in strong combination.
  </li>
</ul>
==> Look at top ranking countries in the Happiness Index and identify policies that relate to the aforementioned predictors

## Implications
### Policy
<ul>
  <li>
    Countries can use happiness metrics as a blueprint for relevant policies that would improving well-being create sustainable development and global well-being
  </li>
</ul>

### Broader Impact
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Improved Global Stability:</b> Happier nations are often healthier, more productive, and more stable politically and economically.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Social Equity:</b> Policies that enhance happiness often reduce inequality, fostering more inclusive societies.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Inspiration for Developing Nations:</b> The index serves as a framework for nations striving to improve the quality of life despite economic limitations.
  </li>
</ul>
